  Agile focuses on user-end point needs, and user stories is a good tool to implement them into our programs.  By
creating detailed user experience of how and what they want the program to do.  Makes eliminating unwanted features
that would otherwise be added in and make maintaining and updating the product more difficult and expensive.  We should
approach developing programs by determining what functionalities it will need.  So, finding what the user values most
is the best solution.  I feel the key to being a good team member is communication.
